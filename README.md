# arch-setup
This is a collective of my programs, scripts, and dotfiles that I  currently use for arch and is seen on the tech videos for my youtube channel "Vastly One"
Everything found here is a personal collection and culmination of things I am currently using and or made over my time with arch and various other Unix based operating systems, this is used as an ease of going through my head when watching my videos, I highly encourage not directly using everything that I have here and make your own decisions on what you enjoy and like, but I do realize some people have no idea what they like and have never tried some of the programs I have used here and just saw some random video on a cool xenon and wanted to go deeper into what is possible, and I welcome that entirely, a collective list of currently used/written programs, scripts and dotfiles is provided in currentlyused.md and the previously used ones are found in graveyard.md
